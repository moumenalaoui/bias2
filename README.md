## Project Overview

This system represents an automated policy analysis, combining multiple AI techniques to process UN Security Council reports at scale. The pipeline extracts structured quantitative data, performs bias analysis using established academic frameworks, and generates cross-report intelligence that reveals patterns invisible to human analysts.

## Core System Architecture

### Hierarchical Intelligence System

The system operates on three distinct analytical layers:

1. **Individual Report Processing Layer**
   - Quantitative data extraction using GPT-4o with structured prompts
   - Bias analysis implementation of Entman's framing theory
   - Legal violation mapping against UNSCR 1701 (2006) articles
   - Entity resolution for consistent actor identification

2. **Pattern Synthesis Engine**
   - Temporal correlation analysis across multiple reports
   - Geographic clustering of violations and incidents
   - Actor behavior evolution tracking over time
   - Bias pattern shift detection and quantification

3. **Meta-Intelligence Engine**
   - Cross-report pattern synthesis using GPT-4o
   - Predictive analytics for bias evolution
   - Institutional bias fingerprinting
   - Strategic intelligence generation

### Technical Implementation

The system processes documents through a seven-stage pipeline:

1. **PDF Upload and Preprocessing** - Hybrid text extraction using Marker PDF parser with fallback to OCR
2. **Structured Data Conversion** - Conversion to JSONL format for efficient processing
3. **Quantitative Data Extraction** - GPT-4o API calls with structured extraction prompts
4. **Bias Analysis** - Implementation of Entman's framing theory
5. **Pattern Synthesis** - Cross-report correlation analysis
6. **Meta-Intelligence Generation** - Insights using GPT-4o on synthesized patterns
7. **Results Presentation** - Interactive web interface with downloadable outputs

## Core Analysis Components

### Quantitative Data Extraction System

**Methodology**: GPT-4o with sophisticated prompt engineering using structured JSON output, confidence scoring (0.0-1.0), entity recognition, and legal mapping to UNSCR 1701 (2006).
